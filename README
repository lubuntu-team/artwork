Organisation of the source
==========================

This branch contains all the theme of Lubuntu. A prefix with 4 digits is used
to identify the release of each items, each current items which don't have
digits. After each release, all items are copied with the digits.

When it's possible, symlink are used to link current item, with the last one with a digit.
Example : 
For the logout banner, the default file is usr/share/lubuntu/images/logout-banner.png
but for 12.04 release, it's just a link to the file usr/share/lubuntu/images/1204-logout-banner.png
